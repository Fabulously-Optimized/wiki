# Capes

FO supports capes from Mojang, OptiFine, MinecraftCapes, Wynntils and Cosmetica.

{% hint style="warning" %}
FO does not host any paid-for capes or cosmetics, nor does it encourage YOU to buy them from any provider. Instead, FO provides instructions for YOU to get a free cape, and it also gives YOU options to use some cosmetics YOU had previously obtained from other providers.
{% endhint %}

## Official Mojang capes

All official capes by Mojang are automatically supported by FO, without additional configuration.

{% hint style="success" %}
Mojang has recently been releasing more and more official capes for completing certain actions during game events. Read more [about capes on the Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Cape#Cross-platform_capes).

To be informed of those events as they happen, ensure you have the **Other news** role on the [FO Discord server](https://download.fo/discord)!
{% endhint %}

## Get a free cape

1. Sign up on [MinecraftCapes](https://minecraftcapes.net/account/login)
2. Draw and download a cape on the [SkinMC Minecraft Cape Editor](https://skinmc.net/capes/editor)
3. If you want to get the official FO cape:
   1. Open the [official FO cape](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/raw/main/cape.png) page
   2. Right-click on the image
   3. Click on **Save image as...**
4. Upload the cape you chose on the [MinecraftCapes page](https://minecraftcapes.net/upload-cape)
5. You can now enjoy your cape in Minecraft! Users with FO or MinecraftCapes will also see it

## Error: "UPDATE YOUR MOD"

If you're using an older version of FO, you may get an "Update your mod" message. This is due to an update to MinecraftCapes' server. See the [issue on MinecraftCapes' GitHub](https://github.com/CaelTheColher/Capes/issues/118).

There are multiple ways to solve this problem: choose one only.

* Update FO to its latest version (recommended). See [instructions to update FO](../../how-to/update/)
* Disable MinecraftCapes entirely. You'll not be able to get the free cape:
  1. Open <kbd>**Options...**</kbd>
  2. Open <kbd>**Skin Customization...**</kbd>
  3. Click on the <kbd>**Capes**</kbd> icon
  4. Click on the <kbd>**Toggle**</kbd> button
  5. Set <kbd>**MinecraftCapes**</kbd> to <kbd>**OFF**</kbd>
  6. Click on <kbd>**Done**</kbd> three times
* [Disable the Capes mod](../../how-to/disable-mods/), which causes the problem, then [add one of these mods](../../how-to/add-mods/):
  * [MinecraftCapes](https://modrinth.com/mod/minecraftcapes): does not support all providers, rather only MinecraftCapes and vanilla
  * [Cosmetica](https://modrinth.com/mod/cosmetica): its configuration is very different to that of FO and must be tweaked manually to your needs
