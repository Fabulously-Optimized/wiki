# Telemetry

**Telemetry Data Collection**, previously known as **Snooper**, refers to Minecraft's methods of collecting analytics about the user. Read more about [Minecraft's telemetry options](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Snooper).

While telemetry is not inherently bad, as it may help developers better support their users' devices (for example when it comes to performance), it may be unwanted and unexpected.

FO disables all forms of telemetry by default, giving the user the choice to opt-in if willing. This is because of three reasons:

* In accordance to the [Transparency principle](../about/#transparency), we believe telemetry should be opt-in
* Snooper collects too much data even in minimal configuration, for example the user's Xbox ID
* FO may interfere with Mojang's data: performance gains from its mods do not exist in vanilla

{% hint style="danger" %}
FO cannot and does not disable telemetry collected by the launcher or by the OS.
