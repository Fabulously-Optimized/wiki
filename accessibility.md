  * Narrator can be enabled on any screen by holding `Ctrl` and pressing `B`.
* Users can search for and select [multiple languages](language-support.md)
  * User's native language is automatically applied (where supported)

* Game controllers are supported
* Local worlds can optionally be played with friends [through the Internet](disclaimers.md#privacy-and-security)
