# Accessibility

Fabulously Optimized is designed to be accessible for everyone, and as such contains the following accessibility features on its latest version.

* The first-run accessibility screen is not used, to make the first-run setup smoother and faster. Instead, users can continue to take advantage of the menu's hotkeys.
  * Languages screen can be accessed by pressing `→` (right arrow) `Enter` or clicking the ![Language](https://minecraft.wiki/images/LanguageButton.png) button.
