4. Drag the ZIP file into the shader pack screen
5. Select the shader, make sure _Shaders_ is set to enabled and click `Apply`

### Fabulous shaders

"Fabulous shaders" are vanilla shaders that work by enabling _Fabulous!_ graphics in video settings and getting a specific resource pack. _May or may not work in FO._

* [Depth Shaders resource pack](https://github.com/onnowhere/depth\_shaders/releases)
* [More shaders can be found on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/shaders?g=categories%3A%27vanilla%27)

#### Installation 

1. Go to `Options` -> `Video Settings` -> `Quality` -> `Graphics: Fabulous!`
2. Download any [Fabulous shader pack](https://modrinth.com/shaders?g=categories%3A%27vanilla%27)
3. Move the shader pack to `resourcepacks` folder or drag it into the resourcepacks screen
4. Apply the resource pack in resource packs screen

### Core shaders

"Core shaders" are a kind of vanilla shaders utilized by resource packs to adjust the vanilla HUD and add special effects to specific blocks. These usually do _not_ change landscapes overall and _may or may not work in FO._

Examples of working core shaders of [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs/):
* Translucent Spyglass Overlay
* No Spyglass Overlay

Examples of **not** working core shaders of [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs/):
* ~~Mob Spawn Indicator~~
* ~~Wavy Leaves~~
* ~~Wavy Plants~~
* ~~Wavy Water~~

Luckily those features can be replicated with [OptiFine shaders](#optifine-shaders) or [other mods](adding-more-mods.md), so you're not missing out.

**Resource pack developers**: you may try to make your pack work in Sodium [with this mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium-shader-support) or [this manifest (upcoming)](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/pull/2206).

#### Installation

1. [Download a core shader-using resource pack from Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/resourcepacks?f=categories%3A%27core-shaders%27)
2. Move the resource pack to `resourcepacks` folder or drag it into the resourcepacks screen
3. Apply the resource pack in resource packs screen
4. See if it works.
   * If yes, enjoy!
   * If not, it is recommended to use OptiFine shaders or other mods for the same purpose. 
       * You may, alternatively, disable Sodium and related mods if you really want them to work, but that will harm your performance too.

### Canvas shaders

[Canvas Renderer](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/canvas-renderer) is a mod that provides a new type of shaders that may be better optimized for powerful computers. 

Canvas shaders are **not supported by default on FO**. By replacing some mods, you can still make them work, however.
