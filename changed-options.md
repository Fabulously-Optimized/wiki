# Changed options

Fabulously Optimized changes some default options of Minecraft to improve your gameplay.

Because the pack is using YOSBR, the options will only change if you do not have `options.txt` or mod-specific files in `config` folder already, e.g. by using a clean profile. That also means you can freely update the pack without losing your settings!

**P.S. This table has 5 columns. Scroll right if you can't see them!**

### Options

### Resource packs

Fabulously Optimized enables relevant mod-provided resource packs and bundles some resource packs for better experience.

- [Mod Menu Helper](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/tree/main/Resource%20Packs/Mod%20Menu%20Helper) (FO-exclusive) - explains what each mod does in a consistent and clear way on Mod Menu
- [Chat Reporting Helper](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/chat-reporting-helper) - explains [chat reporting](chat-reporting-faq.md) in a clear way by simplifying vanilla and No Chat Reports tooltips and No Chat Reports icons
- [Fast Better Grass](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/fast-better-grass) - imitates OptiFine's "Better Grass" (fast mode)
- [Translations for Sodium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/translations-for-sodium) - adds unofficial translations for Sodium (video settings)

The resource packs use minimal resources, [can be translated to your language](language-support.md) and they will work with other resource packs.

### Fixed bugs

Fabulously Optimized includes some mods that fix vanilla bugs.
[Similar to the mod inclusion policy](principles.md), they must be meaningful to 70%+ users to get enabled (e.g. FPS drops, crashes, platform-specific annoyances...).

#### Requesting a bugfix

Want to get a bug fixed in Fabulously Optimized? Here's what you'll need to do:

1. Find the actual bug [in Mojang's bug tracker](https://bugs.mojang.com/projects/MC/issues?filter=allopenissues)
2. Request it or look at its status on [Debugify's bug tracker](https://github.com/W-OVERFLOW/Debugify/issues)
3. Once implemented (or confirmed to be) in Debugify, [request an option change in FO](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues/new?assignees=\&labels=option\&template=setting-request.yml)
4. Describe the bug, mention the mod that fixes it and why it is important to 70-80% of users
5. If accepted, expect the fix to be enabled in the next version of FO :)

### Configuring mods

The modpack is already configured for the best performance and simplest experience for most users.

If you want to configure something, you'll most likely find it on `Options...` โ `Video Settings...`. If you have a powerful computer or monitor, you may want to disable Vsync there.

For other things like dynamic lights, better grass and zoom:

1. Click `Mods`
2. Read the descriptions of the mods to see what they do
3. If the pencil is blue, you can configure the mod by clicking the config button ![config](https://i.ibb.co/j35cBtn/image.png)
   * If you don't see any pencils, you don't have the Mod Menu Helper resource pack enabled for some reason. Click `Done` โ `Options...` โ `Resource Packs...` โ `โต` on "Mod Menu Helper.zip" โ `Done` โ go to point 1 of this tutorial

If you need to disable a mod, [see this wiki page](disabling-mods.md).
