# How to Update: Minecraft Launcher

{% hint style="danger" %}
**You should ALWAYS [make backups](../backup/vanilla.md) before updating**.

As with any other piece of software, updates may go wrong for many reasons, including but not limited to: the launcher, the hardware, your custom configuration, the mods you added... and, rarely, FO as well.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Installer" %}

Follow the [installation instructions](../install/vanilla.md) again.

You may find a `paigaldaja_meta.json` file in the same folder as the installer. Don't worry: this is just a configuration file for smoother future updates.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Manual" %}
If you've installed FO manually, you must reinstall it for every update.

Follow the [installation instructions](../install/vanilla.md) again. You may skip _step 1_ because Java is already installed.
{% endtab %}
