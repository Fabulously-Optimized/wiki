# CurseForge App

{% hint style="danger" %}
**You should ALWAYS [make backups](../backup/curseforge-app.md) before updating**.

As with any other piece of software, updates may go wrong for many reasons, including but not limited to: the launcher, the hardware, your custom configuration, the mods you added... and, rarely, FO as well.
{% endhint %}

1. Open the **CurseForge App**
2. Select <kbd>**Minecraft**</kbd> from the grid or from the sidebar
3. In **My Modpacks**, right-click on <kbd>**Fabulously Optimized**</kbd>
4. Click on the <kbd>**Change Version**</kbd> button
5. If you cannot find the <kbd>**Change Version**</kbd> button, it means you've added custom mods:
   1. Click on the <kbd>**three dots**</kbd> button
   2. Click on <kbd>**Profile Options**</kbd>
   3. Uncheck the <kbd>**Allow content management for this profile**</kbd> checkbox
   4. Click on <kbd>**Continue**</kbd>
6. If you do not want the latest version, select the version you want from the dropdown
7. Click on <kbd>**Continue**</kbd>. FO should now get updated
8. If you've followed _step 5_, remember to check the <kbd>**Allow content management for this profile**</kbd> checkbox again
9. Once updated, click on <kbd>**Play**</kbd> to launch the instance. Minecraft should open up
10. If you can see the newly installed version in the bottom-right corner, you're done!
