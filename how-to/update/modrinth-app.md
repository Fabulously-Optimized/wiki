# Modrinth App

{% hint style="danger" %}
**You should ALWAYS [make backups](../backup/modrinth-app.md) before updating**.

As with any other piece of software, updates may go wrong for many reasons, including but not limited to: the launcher, the hardware, your custom configuration, the mods you added... and, rarely, FO as well.
{% endhint %}

1. Open the **Modrinth App**
2. Click on the <kbd>**Library**</kbd> section
3. Select the existing **Fabulously Optimized** instance
4. Click on the <kbd>**Update modpack**</kbd> button on the top-right
5. If you do not want the latest version, select the version you want from the dropdown
6. Click on the <kbd>**two-arrows**</kbd> button. FO should get updated
7. Once updated, launch **Fabulously Optimized**. Minecraft should open up
8. If you can see the newly installed version in the bottom-right corner, you're done!
