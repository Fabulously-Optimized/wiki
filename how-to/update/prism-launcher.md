# How to Update: Prism Launcher

{% hint style="danger" %}
**You should ALWAYS [make backups](../backup/prism-launcher.md) before updating**.

As with any other piece of software, updates may go wrong for many reasons, including but not limited to: the launcher, the hardware, your custom configuration, the mods you added... and, rarely, FO as well.
{% endhint %}

1. Open the **Prism Launcher**
2. Select the existing FO instance
3. Click on **Edit** in the sidebar
4. Select **Modrinth** in the tab list
5. If you do not want the latest version, select the version you want from the dropdown
6. Click on the **Update pack** button. A prompt should pop up
7. Click on **Yes**. FO should get updated <!-- TODO: Are you sure? -->
8. Once updated, launch the instance. Minecraft should open up
9. If you can see the newly installed version in the bottom-right corner, you're done!
