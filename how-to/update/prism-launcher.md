# Prism Launcher

{% hint style="danger" %}
**You should ALWAYS [make backups](../backup/prism-launcher.md) before updating**.

As with any other piece of software, updates may go wrong for many reasons, including but not limited to: the launcher, the hardware, your custom configuration, the mods you added... and, rarely, FO as well.
{% endhint %}

1. Open the **Prism Launcher**
2. Select the existing <kbd>**Fabulously Optimized**</kbd> instance
3. Click on <kbd>**Edit**</kbd> in the sidebar
4. Select <kbd>**Modrinth**</kbd> in the tab list
5. If you do not want the latest version, select the version you want from the dropdown
6. Click on the <kbd>**Update pack**</kbd> button. A prompt should pop up
7. Click on <kbd>**Yes**</kbd>. FO should get updated
8. Once updated, launch **Fabulously Optimized**. Minecraft should open up
9. If you can see the newly installed version in the bottom-right corner, you're done!
