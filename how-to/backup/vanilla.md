# How to Backup: Minecraft Launcher

1. Open the **Minecraft Launcher**
2. Hover over the FO installation
3. Click on the **Folder** button
4. Open another folder to move your data to, like Documents
5. Copy the following files from the folder you opened in _step 3_ to the folder you opened in _step 4_:
   * `saves`: Your local worlds
   * `resourcepacks`: Your resource packs, if any
   * `shaders`: Your shaders, if any
   * `screenshots`: Your screenshots, if any
   * `server.dat`: Your multiplayer servers, if any
   * `options.txt`: Your custom options and keybinds, if any

If you want to restore your data, move the files you copied in _step 5_ back. If you're asked to replace the [default FO `resourcepacks`](../../info/resource-packs.md), do not!
