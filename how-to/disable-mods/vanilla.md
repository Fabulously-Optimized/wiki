# How to Disable Mods: Minecraft Launcher

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do NOT disable "API" or "library" mods, because the other mods need them.
{% endhint %}

1. Open the **Minecraft Launcher**
2. Select the Fabric installation
3. Click on **Folder** button
4. Open the `mods/` folder
5. Find the mod you want to disable
6. Rename the mod from `mod-name.jar` to `mod-name.jar.disabled`
7. If you want to re-enable the mod, rename `mod-name.jar.disabled` to `mod-name.jar`

{% hint style="info" %}
If you can't see the `.jar` extension in the file name, follow this [tutorial to show file extensions](https://thewindowsclub.com/show-file-extensions-in-windows).
