# How to Uninstall: CurseForge App

{% hint style="danger" %}
**You should ALWAYS [make backups](../backup/curseforge-app.md) before uninstalling**.

As with any other piece of software, updates may go wrong for many reasons, including but not limited to: the launcher, the hardware, your custom configuration, the mods you added... and, rarely, FO as well.
{% endhint %}

1. Open the **CurseForge App**
2. Select **Minecraft** from the grid or from the sidebar
3. In **My Modpacks**, right-click on **Fabulously Optimized**
4. Click on **Delete Profile**
5. Click on **Delete**
