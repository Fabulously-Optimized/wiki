# How to Uninstall: Modrinth App

{% hint style="danger" %}
**You should ALWAYS [make backups](../backup/modrinth-app.md) before uninstalling**.

As with any other piece of software, updates may go wrong for many reasons, including but not limited to: the launcher, the hardware, your custom configuration, the mods you added... and, rarely, FO as well.
{% endhint %}

1. Open the **Modrinth App**
2. Click on the **Library**
3. Right-click on the FO instance
4. Click on **Delete**
5. Click on **Delete**
