# How to Uninstall: Prism Launcher

{% hint style="danger" %}
**You should ALWAYS [make backups](../backup/prism-launcher.md) before uninstalling**.

As with any other piece of software, updates may go wrong for many reasons, including but not limited to: the launcher, the hardware, your custom configuration, the mods you added... and, rarely, FO as well.
{% endhint %}

1. Open the **Prism Launcher**
2. Right-click on the FO instance
3. Click on **Delete**
4. Click on **Yes**
