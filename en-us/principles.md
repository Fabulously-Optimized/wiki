# Principles

I am aware that since Fabulously Optimized was created, several similar packs have started appearing on Curseforge. So what separates this from the rest?

* **Accessibility**  - Fabulously Optimized supports [four launchers](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized#downloads), is [hosted on three sites](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized#downloads), [has many video tutorials](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized#reviews) and [supports various languages](language-support.md).
* **Community** - Fabulously Optimized is developed with the community, [helping you fix problems](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues),  [considering your mod suggestions](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues), [hosting public votes for mod inclusion](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues/21#issuecomment-998162829) and [even reverting changes if they were not popular](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#131-2020-09-29). The author also contributes to the mods themselves by reporting issues and suggesting fixes.
* **Consistency** - Fabulously Optimized must be sustainable, 100% server-compatible and it should work similarly across versions. I carefully consider every new mod and change I include to make sure it would work well, feel vanilla and be available in the future.
* **Familiarity** - main priority is having parity with OptiFine, but sometimes Forge, Bedrock Edition and snapshots are considered as well.
* **Neutrality** - the modpack should only give you the essential tools and fixes to customize your game, not include any opinionated extras itself (e.g. a mod that adds more environment sounds).
* **Privacy** - you shall not be punished for "having too many mods" or "using the wrong zoom mod". That does not mean I encourage any rule-breaking, only that the client communicates with the servers as little as possible, like vanilla.
* **Transparency** - Fabulously Optimized is [open source](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/LICENSE.md) (including the majority of its mods), documented in this wiki, [changes are outlined](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md), [mods are clearly listed](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized#included-mods) with their creator and purpose.
* **Updates** - Fabulously Optimized [receives fast updates](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) and is one of the first modpacks to upgrade to newer Minecraft versions.

### Why use Fabric?

Some facts about Fabric that can make you reconsider using Forge...

* **Fabric updates fast** - on the same day as Minecraft itself, and so do many of its mods
* **Fabric loads fast** - roughly the same as vanilla Minecraft, unlike Forge that takes minutes to open
* **Fabric is small** - no huge libraries taking space on your computer, for most mods you only need the [Fabric loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)
* **Fabric is popular** - there are [more than 250 pages of Fabric mods on Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods?filter-game-version=2020709689:7499) and [more than 90 pages on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mods?q=\&f=categories%3Afabric) (most overlap though)
* **Fabric is supported** - many mod developers support both Fabric and Forge nowadays, some even move to only Fabric now
* **Fabric is compatible** - many mod developers work together to keep their mods compatible with each other
* **Fabric is easy** - many launchers are supported, and the [installers are accessible right from the homepage](https://fabricmc.net/use/?page=installer)
