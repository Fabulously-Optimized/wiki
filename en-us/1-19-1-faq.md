# 1.19.1 FAQ

### What's the deal with 1.19.1?

Players can report other players' chat messages to Mojang, which may result in a temporary or permanent ban from all multiplayer servers, on all versions of Minecraft: Java Edition.

See [the official help page](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/7149823936781-Player-Reporting-in-Minecraft-Java-Edition) to read about the reporting interaction and offense categories or keep reading to see how it affects you.

### Why is it bad?

* **Banned from all multiplayer** - instead of getting punished on one server, you are getting punished on all, including Realms and others' LAN servers. Maybe you just got angry on one server and want to go to another to relax again? Nope, cannot do that.

* **Realms subscriptions don't get cancelled** - if you get banned, Mojang will not automatically cancel any Realms servers you own, meaning you'll continue to pay for server(s) you cannot access or control.

* **Not sent to server admins** - sending reports to Mojang will result in different judgement and outcomes of the cases - while server admins could punish faster, with a shorter penalty, with different kinds of punishments like mutes and jails, Mojang can only ban people from the entirety of multiplayer or not punish at all.

* **Report reviewers lack context** - players can select 1-4 messages, to which the system will add up to 7 messages before and 2 after the selected ones - at most 40 messages in total. That is a very partial context as it is missing player builds, signs, books, Discord/forum messages, daily general behavior etc.

* **Fairness doesn't scale** - Minecraft has a huge playerbase and if lots of players play it, lots can report each other as well. How can Mojang guarantee a _fair action_ to be done on _thousands_ of reports every day? Compare that to a single server that has less players, therefore less reports and less admins needed.

* **Categories don't match server rules** - for example, if there is an adult-only server that may discuss things like alcohol freely, but when an underage player stumbles upon it, they can report others for things that are clearly allowed and intended by the server.
   
* **Categories are vague** - for example, take the rule "impersonation". How can one be sure a person is who they claim to be with just a few lines of chat? Are they just going to assume it is a lie and ban them? At that point players can not even say who they are because they can get banned either way.

* **Ban reasons and appeals are vague** - [while there is a way to appeal](#what-if-i-still-got-banned), it is not described when and how many times it will be accepted. The fact that _some_ bans are temporary is not really the solution - an unjust ban is an unjust ban. [This issue has already been prevalent in Bedrock Edition.](https://youtu.be/kEfyaAq90kg?t=108)

* **Unfixed exploits** - there are unfixed exploits for spoofing reports that have made it to the stable release. I won't link them here, just be aware that they are a thing and the [No Chat Reports](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-chat-reports) mod (which is in Fabulously Optimized) protects against these.

This is a non-exhaustive list. People have voiced more concerns in various Minecraft communities and the feedback site, search around.

### What does FO do to protect me?

Fabulously Optimized has added a mod called [No Chat Reports](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-chat-reports) that unsigns your messages where possible and otherwise just informs you on whether it is safe to chat.

Look at the right corner of the chat window:
- Full-screen warning & ![red ⚠️](https://i.ibb.co/tzd8CvB/red.png) - you are vulnerable, any chat messages you send may be reported and used against you.
- ![yellow ℹ️](https://i.ibb.co/YXQdJRr/yellow.png) - nobody can report your messages. However, other players will see a red bar on the left of the message, ![red markings](https://i.ibb.co/ftRMqHL/exclamation.png) on the right and if they enable the vanilla `Only Show Secure Chat` option, they won't see your chat messages at all.
  - Unfortunately that is what most 1.19+ servers will see, even if the server has additional protections in place. In the future the mod may be able to show ![green ✅](https://i.ibb.co/LPXNKRM/green.png) in more cases, but right now you can ask your server admins for clarification regarding that.
- ![green ✅](https://i.ibb.co/LPXNKRM/green.png) - you can chat securely. Nobody can report anyone, nobody has a red bar or ![red markings](https://i.ibb.co/ftRMqHL/exclamation.png) on the chat and nobody's chat will get hidden by `Only Show Secure Chat`.

The reporting button itself is also disabled on all servers to discourage its use against others.

Also, FO has disabled chat previews since the first 4.0.0 alpha, this protects your messages from being sent to the server before you actually press Enter.

### Why not stay on 1.19?

Despite the report button not being there, the chat signing already exists in it, so it is not any safer than 1.19.1. If you want to stay on an older version, use the latest version for 1.18.2.

### Why not stay on 1.18.2?

It is safe from reports so you are free to play it for as long as you like. The modpack will still focus on "fixing" the new version(s) rather than continuously updating the old one.

### What if someone really breaks the rules?

Do what you always did.

- If an user is being annoying, hide their messages by clicking the chat icon near the username in Social Interactions or, in some servers, `/ignore (username)`.
- If an user has broken the rules of the server, report it to server administration. This is usually done by `/report`, `/helpop`, server forum or Discord.
- If an user is talking about commiting suicide, talk to them and [give local help resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines). 
- If an user is doing or threatening illegal actions, report it to server admins and local police. Provide them with as much context as possible, including screenshots.

### What if I still got banned?

If you feel like you've been banned unfairly, [see "How to submit a case review" here to appeal](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards#main-content). Fill the form throughly with any information you have and make sure you select "Minecraft: Java" as the game. After submitting simply wait for their response and hope for the best.

Fabulously Optimized does not condone any form of ban evasion, do not even ask.

### I am a server owner. How can I protect my users?

See [server setup](server-setup.md). If you are a player, you can send that page to your server admins.

[As said above](#what-does-fo-do-to-protect-me), most of those methods will still show ![yellow ℹ️](https://i.ibb.co/YXQdJRr/yellow.png) in chat, so do inform your users as well.

### I want to give feedback to Mojang.

Great! Use the [official feedback site](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us):
* [Give feedback on the chat reporting](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/7320990094733-Player-Chat-Reporting-Feedback-)
* [The most popular request for reverting chat reporting](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/6977558665997-Mojang-please-for-the-love-of-your-game-don-t-add-a-chat-report-feature-)
* [Overall snapshot category](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/topics/360001692331-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Snapshots?sort_by=votes)

### What would make the system fair?

One of the following:

- Sending the reports to server admins instead of Mojang would be the most preferable, as they have the most context to take the appropriate action and players would have a consistent way of reporting on every server.
- Making the whole system opt-in (or out) would also be reasonable as then only the servers that need this help would enable it.
- Implementing the system only on Realms or other Mojang-partnering servers.
- Not implementing the system at all because there are enough moderation tools built already.

This is a non-exhaustive list. People have posted more ideas in various Minecraft communities and the feedback site, search around.

### I still think the system is fair.

Feel free to [disable the mod](disabling-mods.md) [No Chat Reports](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-chat-reports) on your instance.

### I actually came here to learn, when will FO 4.1.0 stable be released?

[Some time in August.](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues/343)
