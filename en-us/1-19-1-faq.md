# 1.19.1 FAQ

### What's the deal with 1.19.1?

Players can report other players' chat messages to Mojang, which may result in a temporary or permanent ban from all multiplayer servers.

[See the official help page to read about the reporting interaction and offense categories.](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/7149823936781-Player-Reporting-in-Minecraft-Java-Edition)

### Why is it bad?

* **Sent to Microsoft instead of server admins** - this system would be amazing if the reports were sent to server admins, it could create a truly consistent and smooth way of reporting players in all servers. But sending the reports to the wrong entity does inheritly mean a different judgement and different outcomes (admins could decide to punish differently than just by a ban) of the reported cases.

* **Lack of context** - Players can select 1-4 messages, to which the system will add up to 7 messages before and 2 after the selected ones - at most 40 messages in total. That is a very partial context as it is missing player builds, signs, books, Discord/forum messages, daily general behavior etc.

* **Categories that don't match server rules** - for example, if there is an adult-only server that may discuss things like alcohol freely, but when an underage player stumbles upon it, they can report others for things that are clearly allowed and intended by the server.
   
* **Vague categories** - for example, take the rule "impersonation". How can one be sure a person is who they claim to be with just a few lines of chat? Are they just going to assume it is a lie and ban them? At that point players can not even say who they are because they can get banned either way.

* **Scalability** - Minecraft has a huge playerbase and if lots of players play it, lots can report each other as well. How can Mojang guarantee a _fair action_ to be done on _thousands_ of reports every day? Compare that to a single server that has less players, therefore less reports and less admins needed.

* **Vague appeals** - [while there is a way to appeal](#what-if-i-still-got-banned), it is not described when and how many times it will be accepted. The fact that _some_ bans are temporary is not really the solution - an unjust ban is an unjust ban. This issue has already been prevalent in Bedrock Edition.

This is a non-exhaustive list. People have voiced their concerns in various Minecraft communities and the feedback site, search around.

### So what does FO do to protect me?

Fabulously Optimized has added a mod called [No Chat Reports](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-chat-reports) that unsigns your messages where possible and otherwise just informs you on whether it is safe to chat.

- If you see a full-screen warning on server join and a red ⚠️ near chatbox, you are vulnerable - any chat messages you send may be reported and used against you.
- If you see a yellow ℹ️ near chatbox, you are likely safe even if others report you. However, other players will see red markings near your messages and if they enable the vanilla "Only Show Secure Chat" option, they won't see your chat messages at all.
  - Unfortunately that is what most 1.19+ servers will see, even if they have plugins to disable chat reporting server-side. In the future NCR may be able to show green checkmark in more cases, but right now ask your server admins whether the server has additional protections in place.
- If you see a green ✅ near chatbox, you can chat securely. Nobody can report anyone, nobody has red markings on the chat and nobody's chat will get hidden by "Only Show Secure Chat".

The reporting button itself is also disabled for FO users to discourage its use against others.

### Why not stay on 1.19?

Despite the report button not being there, the chat signing already exists in it, so it is not any safer than 1.19.1. If you want to stay on an older version, use the latest version for 1.18.2.

### Why not stay on 1.18.2?

It is safe so you are free to play it for as long as you like. The modpack will still focus on "fixing" the new version(s) rather than continuously updating the old one.

### What if someone really breaks the rules?

Do what you always did.

* If an user is being annoying, hide their messages by clicking the chat icon near the username in Social Interactions or, in some servers, `/ignore (username)`.
* If an user has broken the rules of the server, report it to server administration. This is usually done by `/report`, `/helpop`, server forum or Discord.
* If an user is doing or threatening illegal actions, report it to server admins and local police. Provide them with as much context as possible, including screenshots.

### What if I still got banned?

If you feel like you've been banned unfairly, [see "How to submit a case review" here to appeal](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards#main-content). Fabulously Optimized does condone any form of ban evasion.

### I am a server owner. How can I protect my users?

See [server setup](server-setup.md). If you are a player, you can send this page to your server admins.

### I want to give feedback to Mojang.

Great! Use the [official feedback site](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us):

* [The most popular request for reverting chat reporting](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/6977558665997-Mojang-please-for-the-love-of-your-game-don-t-add-a-chat-report-feature-)

### What would make the system fair?

One of the following:

- Sending the reports to server admins instead of Mojang would be the most preferable, as they have the most context to take the appropriate action and players would have a consistent way of reporting on every server.
- Making the whole system opt-in (or out) would also be reasonable as then only the servers that need this help would enable it.
- Implementing the system only on Realms or other Mojang-partnering servers.
- Not implementing the system at all because there are enough moderation tools built already.

### I still think the system is fair.

Feel free to [disable the mod](disabling-mods.md) [No Chat Reports](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-chat-reports) on your instance.
