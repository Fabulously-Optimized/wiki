# Disabling mods

### What's the deal with 1.19.1?

Chat messages can be reported to Mojang, which may result in a temporary or permanent ban from all multiplayer servers.

### Why is it bad?

#### Videos

- [Simple explanation](https://youtu.be/rdoFUhd0EkI)
- [Timeline of events](https://youtu.be/kEfyaAq90kg)
- [Technical explanation](https://youtu.be/hYAUEMlugyw?t=43))

Some parts of the videos may be out of date, mainly report categories and exploits. Problems with ethics and overall technical approach still remain.

### Why not stay on 1.19?

Despite the report button not being there, the framework already exists in it, so it is not any safer than 1.19.1. Plus, due to chat signing incompatibilities it is likely servers will not support it for long either.

### Why not stay on 1.18.2?

Because it's outdated. You are free to play it for as long as you like (it is safe), but I would rather focus on "fixing" the new versions than keep updating the old one.

### So what does FO do to protect me?

FO has added a mod called No Chat Reports that unsigns your messages where possible and otherwise just informs you on whether it is safe to chat.

- If you see a full-screen warning on server join and a red ⚠️ near chatbox, you are vulnerable - any chat messages you send may be reported to use against you.
- If you see a yellow ℹ️ near chatbox, you are likely safe even if others report you and others will see red markings near your messages.
- If you see a green ✅ near chatbox, your chat is safe, has no red markings and nobody can report anyone.

The reporting button itself is also disabled for FO users to discourage its use against others.

### What if someone really breaks the rules?

Do what you always did.

* If an user is being annoying, hide their messages by clicking the chat icon near the username in Social Interactions or, in some servers, `/ignore (username)`.
* If an user has broken the rules of the server, report it to server administration. This is usually done by `/report`, `/helpop`, server forum or Discord.
* If an user is doing or threatening illegal actions, report it to server admins and local police. Provide them with as much context as possible, including screenshots.

### What if I still got banned?

If you feel you've been unfairly banned already, [see "How to submit a case review" here to appeal](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards#main-content). Fabulously Optimized does condone any form of ban evasion.

### I am a server owner. How can I protect my users?

See [server setup](server-setup.md).

### What would make the system fair?

One of the following:

- Sending the reports to server admins instead of Mojang would be the most preferable, as they have the most context to take the appropriate action and players would have a consistent way of reporting on every server.

- Making the whole system opt-in (or out) would also be reasonable as then only the servers that need this help would enable it.

- Implementing the system only on Realms or other Mojang-partnering servers.

- Not implementing the system at all because there are enough moderation tools built already.

### I still think the system is fair.

Feel free to [disable the mod](disabling-mods.md) [No Chat Reports](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-chat-reports) on your instance.
