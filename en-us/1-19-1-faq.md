# 1.19.1 FAQ

### What's the deal with 1.19.1?

Players can report other players' chat messages to Mojang, which may result in a temporary or permanent ban from all multiplayer servers.

### Why is it bad?

* **Sent to Microsoft instead of server admins** - this system would be amazing if the reports were sent to server admins, it could create a truly consistent and smooth way of reporting players in all servers. But sending the reports to the wrong entity does inheritly mean a different judgment of the reported cases. And different outcomes too - admins may not even know they should ban a person from their community spaces (like forums) because they were just not notified of it.

* **Report categories that do not match the server rules** - despite removing some categories, there are still things that servers may want to or may not want to enforce that are missing/added to those rules here. For example, if there is an adult-only server that may discuss things like alcohol freely, but when an underage player stumbles upon it, they can report others for things that are clearly allowed and intended by the server.

* **Lack of context** - few lines of server chat are a lot less context than player builds, signs, Discord/forum general behavior etc. Only server admins have the full context. 
Also, take the rule "impersonation". How can you be sure a person is who they claim to be with few lines of chat? Are you going to do a background search on them, based on their Microsoft profile? _(shudders)_ Are you just going to assume they lie and ban them? At that point you can not even say who you are in any way because you can get banned either way.

* **Vague appeals** - [while there is a way to appeal](#what-if-i-still-got-banned), it is not described when and how many times it will be accepted. The fact that _some_ bans are temporary is not really the solution as an unjust ban is an unjust ban. This issue has already been prevalent in Bedrock Edition.

* **Bots and mass reporting** - there is still no wording on how would they solve the issue of bots and mass unjust reporting. Okay, blocking multiple reports from a single account are easy... (Or are they? Imagine being a lawful citizen who joined an anarchy server where 10+ users do already break the Community Guidelines. Who will get banned, you for reporting or them for actually breaking the rules?) but what about an x amount of players reporting an user they don't like for a message that is taken out of context? That could happen to, for example, YouTube celebrities, long-time players of a server or people with rare capes.

### So what does FO do to protect me?

Fabulously Optimized has added a mod called [No Chat Reports](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-chat-reports) that unsigns your messages where possible and otherwise just informs you on whether it is safe to chat.

- If you see a full-screen warning on server join and a red ⚠️ near chatbox, you are vulnerable - any chat messages you send may be reported and used against you.
- If you see a yellow ℹ️ near chatbox, you are likely safe even if others report you. However, other players will see red markings near your messages and if they enable the vanilla "Only Show Secure Chat" option, they won't see your chat messages at all.
- If you see a green ✅ near chatbox, you can chat securely. Nobody has red markings on the chat and nobody can report anyone.

The reporting button itself is also disabled for FO users to discourage its use against others.

### Why not stay on 1.19?

Despite the report button not being there, the chat signing already exists in it, so it is not any safer than 1.19.1. If you want to stay on an older version, use the latest version for 1.18.2.

### Why not stay on 1.18.2?

It is safe so you are free to play it for as long as you like. The modpack will still focus on "fixing" the new version(s) rather than continuously updating the old one.

### What if someone really breaks the rules?

Do what you always did.

* If an user is being annoying, hide their messages by clicking the chat icon near the username in Social Interactions or, in some servers, `/ignore (username)`.
* If an user has broken the rules of the server, report it to server administration. This is usually done by `/report`, `/helpop`, server forum or Discord.
* If an user is doing or threatening illegal actions, report it to server admins and local police. Provide them with as much context as possible, including screenshots.

### What if I still got banned?

If you feel like you've been banned unfairly, [see "How to submit a case review" here to appeal](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards#main-content). Fabulously Optimized does condone any form of ban evasion.

### I want to give feedback to Mojang.

### I am a server owner. How can I protect my users?

See [server setup](server-setup.md).

### What would make the system fair?

One of the following:

- Sending the reports to server admins instead of Mojang would be the most preferable, as they have the most context to take the appropriate action and players would have a consistent way of reporting on every server.
- Making the whole system opt-in (or out) would also be reasonable as then only the servers that need this help would enable it.
- Implementing the system only on Realms or other Mojang-partnering servers.
- Not implementing the system at all because there are enough moderation tools built already.

### I still think the system is fair.

Feel free to [disable the mod](disabling-mods.md) [No Chat Reports](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-chat-reports) on your instance.
