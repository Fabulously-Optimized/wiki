### Why Fabric?

* **Fabric updates fast** - on the same day as Minecraft itself, and so do many of its mods
* **Fabric loads fast** - roughly the same as vanilla Minecraft, unlike Forge that takes minutes to open
* **Fabric is small** - no huge libraries taking space on your computer, for most mods you only need the [Fabric loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)
* **Fabric is popular** - there are [more than 180 pages of Fabric mods on Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods?filter-game-version=2020709689:7499) and [more than 60 pages on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mods?q=&f=categories%3Afabric) (most overlap though)
* **Fabric is supported** - many mod developers support both Fabric and Forge nowadays, some even move to only Fabric now
* **Fabric is compatible** - many mod developers work together to keep their mods compatible with each other
* **Fabric is easy** - many launchers are supported, and the [installers are accessible right from the homepage](https://fabricmc.net/use/?page=installer)
