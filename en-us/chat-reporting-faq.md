# Chat Reporting FAQ

## About the system

### What is chat reporting?

In Minecraft 1.19.1 and up, players can report other players' chat messages to Mojang, which may result in a temporary or permanent ban from all multiplayer servers, on all versions of Minecraft: Java Edition.

See [the official help page](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/7149823936781-Player-Reporting-in-Minecraft-Java-Edition) to read about the reporting interaction and offense categories or keep reading to see how it affects you.

### Why is it bad?

* **Banned from all multiplayer** - instead of getting punished on one server, you are getting punished on all, including Realms and others' LAN servers. Maybe you just got angry and sweared at someone on one server and want to go to another to relax again? Nope, cannot do that.

* **Realms subscriptions don't get cancelled** - if you get banned, Mojang will not automatically [pause the subscription](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4410000696077-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realms-Billing-Issues-FAQ#h_01FGCST20673JYZ76PB9BN4BNK) of any Realms servers you own, meaning you'll continue to pay for server(s) you cannot access or control. This makes sense for short-term bans like up to a week, but any longer than that should give an explicit option at least.

* **Not sent to server admins** - sending reports to Mojang will result in different judgement and outcomes of the cases - while server admins could punish faster, with a shorter penalty, with different kinds of punishments like mutes and jails, Mojang can only ban people from the entirety of multiplayer or not punish at all.

* **Report reviewers lack context** - players can select 1-4 messages, to which the system will add up to 9 messages before the selected ones - at most 40 messages in total. That is a very partial context for serious offenses as it is missing player builds, signs, books, Discord/forum messages, daily general behavior etc.

* **Fairness doesn't scale** - Minecraft has a huge playerbase and if lots of players play it, lots can report each other as well. How can Mojang guarantee a _fair action_ to be done on _thousands_ of reports every day? Compare that to a single server that has less players, therefore less reports and less admins needed.

* **Categories don't match server rules** - for example, there can be an adult-only server that may discuss things like alcohol freely, but when an underage player stumbles upon it, they can report others for things that are clearly allowed and intended by the server.
   
* **Categories are vague** - for example, take the rule "impersonation". How can one be sure a person is who they claim to be with just a few lines of chat? Are they just going to assume it is a lie and ban them? At that point players can not even say who they are because they can get punished either way.

* **Ban reasons and appeals are vague** - [while there is a way to appeal](#is-there-a-way-to-appeal-the-ban), it is not described when and how many times it will be accepted. The fact that _some_ bans are temporary is not really the solution - an unjust ban is an unjust ban. [This issue has already been prevalent in Bedrock Edition.](https://youtu.be/kEfyaAq90kg?t=108)

This is a non-exhaustive list. People have voiced more concerns in various Minecraft communities and the feedback site, search around.

### Is there a way to appeal the ban?

Yes, if you [meet their criteria (see "how to submit a case review")](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards#main-content:~:text=HOW%20TO%20SUBMIT%20A%20CASE%20REVIEW). It is unknown how many appeals are accepted.

1. [Open the Case Review request](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360003469452)
2. Select "Minecraft: Java" as the game.
3. Fill the form throughly with all information you have
4. Submit the form
5. Wait patiently for their response

If you own a Realm, you may want to [pause your subscription](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4410000696077-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Realms-Billing-Issues-FAQ#h_01FGCST20673JYZ76PB9BN4BNK) as well.

### What should I do instead when someone breaks the rules?

Do what you always did.

- If an user is being annoying, hide their messages by clicking the chat icon near the username in Social Interactions or, in some servers, `/ignore (username)`.
- If an user has broken the rules of the server, report it to server administration. This is usually done by `/report`, `/helpop`, server forum or Discord.
- If an user is talking about commiting suicide, talk to them and [give local help resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines). 
- If an user is doing or threatening illegal actions, report it to server admins and local police. Provide them with as much context as possible, including screenshots.

### What would make the system fair?

One of the following:

- Sending the reports to server admins instead of Mojang would be the most preferable, as they have the most context to take the appropriate action and players would have a consistent way of reporting on every server.
- Making the whole system opt-in (or out) would also be reasonable as then only the servers that need this help would enable it.
- Implementing the system only on Realms or other Mojang-partnering servers.
- Not implementing the system at all because there are enough moderation tools built already.

This is a non-exhaustive list. People have posted more ideas in various Minecraft communities and the feedback site, search around.

### I am a server owner. How can I protect my users?

See [server setup](server-setup.md#how-to-protect-your-users). If you are a player, you can send that page to your server admins.

### I want to give feedback to Mojang.

Great! Use the [official feedback site](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us):

## Chat reporting and Fabulously Optimized

### What does this modpack do to protect me?

Fabulously Optimized has added a mod called [No Chat Reports](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-chat-reports) that informs you of the availability of chat reporting and makes your messages unreportable on servers that do not require it. It also reverts most of the chat indicators added in 1.19.1, because they clutter the screen and are misleading in many cases.

Look at the right corner of the chat window:
- ![red ⚠️](https://i.ibb.co/tzd8CvB/red.png) - you are vulnerable, any chat messages you send may be reported and used against you.
  - This is always the case on Realms, so if you have that, you should [consider getting a real host](https://www.bisecthosting.com/clients/aff.php?aff=2604) (affiliate link - 25% off first month).
- ![yellow ℹ️](https://i.ibb.co/YXQdJRr/yellow.png) - nobody can report your messages. Depending on the server, other players may see a red bar on the left of the message, ![red markings](https://i.ibb.co/ftRMqHL/exclamation.png) on the right and if they enable the vanilla `Only Show Secure Chat` option, they may not see your chat messages at all. 
  - In practice, these mentioned chat side effects will likely only occur on vanilla servers. Most servers use Paper or Spigot and will take a stance to either disable or enforce chat reporting for everyone.
- ![green ✅](https://i.ibb.co/LPXNKRM/green.png) - you can chat securely. Nobody can report anyone, nobody has a red bar or ![red markings](https://i.ibb.co/ftRMqHL/exclamation.png) on the chat and nobody's chat will get hidden by `Only Show Secure Chat`.
  - This is currently shown for singleplayer and very few public servers. Most servers will still show ![yellow ℹ️](https://i.ibb.co/YXQdJRr/yellow.png) due to technical restrictions, so ask your admin or look at whether the chat reporting icon is grayed out in Social Interactions to confirm whether it has additional protections in place.

The report button itself still works on servers that _force_ reporting (others can report you too if you see ![red ⚠️](https://i.ibb.co/tzd8CvB/red.png)). Please use it only in case of serious danger and even then don't forget to inform the server admins and, if needed, the local police.

The modpack also disables chat previews, which protects your messages from being sent to the server before you actually press Enter.

### I don't want to join chat reporting servers at all!

If you don't think the ![red ⚠️](https://i.ibb.co/tzd8CvB/red.png) icon is enough, you can also re-enable the full-screen warning.

1. Click Mods
2. Search for "No Chat Reports" and click ![config](https://i.ibb.co/j35cBtn/image.png)
3. Select `Technical` tab, set "Whitelist all servers" to `No`
4. `Save changes`

### Is No Chat Reports itself a risk?

No, the mod simply disables chat signing on servers that don't require it. Those that do will have the chat signing (and therefore reports) working the same as they do in vanilla.

Disabling chat signing is not a punishable offense, otherwise Mojang would not have added an option for it in the servers.

### I still think chat reporting is fair.

Understandable, the modpack helps you as well. 

If you join a server and see a ![red ⚠️](https://i.ibb.co/tzd8CvB/red.png) in the bottom right corner of the chat, that server enforces the report system and FO will adhere to it, just like vanilla. Because of that, having [No Chat Reports](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-chat-reports) does benefit you, because in vanilla itself there is no such clear indication (the toast and chat line icons do not accurately work on every server).

## Alternative approaches
 
### Why not stay on 1.19?

- [The modpack opts out from chat reporting in 1.19.1+ as well](#what-does-this-modpack-do-to-protect-me)
- [It is easy for server owners to disable chat reporting in 1.19.1+ anyway](#i-am-a-server-owner.-how-can-i-protect-my-users)
- Most mods are not interested in continuing to support it
- No Chat Reports is outdated, meaning you cannot join all servers
- It is buggy, [1.19.1 fixed several bugs and crashes](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_1.19.1#Fixes)
- If you want to keep using it just for the sake of protest, remember that [1.19 already has the basis for chat reporting - the chat signatures](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_1.19#General).

If you want to stay on an older version, please use the latest version for 1.18.2.

_This section previously claimed that it may be possible for 1.19.1+ players to report 1.19 ones. This turned out to not be the case because [the signing system changed in 1.19.1](https://youtu.be/DobmW1ZUcbQ?t=681)._

### But my favorite server requires 1.19!

Alright, please [send them this link](server-setup.md#how-to-protect-your-users) or [that link](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-server-players) to let them know they don't have to stay on 1.19 just to disable chat reporting.

In the meanwhile you can play in that server by [installing the latest FO](install-instructions.md) and [adding a mod](adding-more-mods.md) called [ViaFabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/viafabric).

Then, after launching the game:

1. Go to Multiplayer
2. Click the `VIA` button in the top right corner
3. Click `Enable client-side`
4. Read the warning and click `Enable`
5. Click `Done` and join your server

When done playing the server, it is recommended to turn it off again:

1. Click the `VIA` button in the top right corner
2. Click `Disable client-side`
3. Click `Done` 

### Why not stay on 1.18.2?

It is safe from reports, you are free to play it for as long as you like. Fabulously Optimized will still focus on optimizing the newest versions (including everything related to the chat reporting) rather than continuously updating the old one.

### Can I use exploits to break the system/avoid getting reported?

No, that makes you more likely to get banned. It is up to the server to decide whether they want the reporting system or not, use that information to choose the servers you play in.

Fabulously Optimized will not include or endorse any exploits.

## Other questions

### Does Java Edition have a profanity filter?

Yes, but currently only on Realms. If you are an adult, you can disable it for yourself [in your minecraft.net profile](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/msaprofile/accountsettings). [Learn more](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/6160517019149)

Profanity by itself is no longer a category one can report other players for.

### Does Mojang monitor my chats?

Maybe, but only on Realms.

[The chat reporting FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/7317376541197-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Player-Reporting-FAQ) says

> This system does not monitor chat – no chat messages are sent to us until a player decides to send a report.
