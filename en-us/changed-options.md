# Changed options

Fabulously Optimized changes some default options of Minecraft to improve your gameplay.

Because the pack is using YOSBR, the options will only change if you do not have `options.txt` or mod-specific files in `config` folder already, e.g. by using a clean profile. That also means you can freely update the pack without losing your settings!

### Options

| Option                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           | Vanilla  | Modpack | Why changed?                                                                                                                             |

### Fixed bugs

Since FO 3.3.0, some mods are included to fix vanilla bugs.\
However, [similar to the mod inclusion policy](principles.md), Fabulously Optimized will not enable bugfixes randomly - they must be meaningful to 70%+ users to get enabled.

#### Requesting a bugfix

Want to get a bug fixed in Fabulously Optimized? Here's what you'll need to do:

1. Find the actual bug [in Mojang's bug tracker](https://bugs.mojang.com/projects/MC/issues?filter=allopenissues)
2. Request it or look at its status on [Debugify's bug tracker](https://github.com/W-OVERFLOW/Debugify/issues)
3. Once implemented (or confirmed to be) in Debugify, [request an option change in FO](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues/new?assignees=\&labels=option\&template=setting-request.yml)
4. Describe the bug, mention the mod that fixes it and why it is important to 70-80% of users
5. If accepted, expect the fix to be enabled in the next version of FO :)

### Configuring mods

The modpack is already configured for the best performance and simplest experience for most users.

If you want to configure something, you'll most likely find it on `Options...` -> `Video Settings...`. If you have a powerful computer or monitor, you may want to disable Vsync there.

For other things like dynamic lights, better grass and zoom:

1. Click `Mods`
2. Read the descriptions of the mods to see what they do
3. If the pencil is blue, you can configure the mod by clicking the config button ![](https://i.ibb.co/j35cBtn/image.png)
     * If you don't see any pencils, you don't have the Mod Menu Helper resource pack enabled for some reason.
        1. Click `Done` -> `Options...` -> `Resource Packs...` -> `โต` on "Mod Menu Helper.zip" -> `Done` -> go to point 1 of this tutorial

If you need to disable a mod, [see this wiki page](disabling-mods.md).

If you have more questions about the mods, [chat with us on Discord!](https://discord.gg/yxaXtaQqdB)
