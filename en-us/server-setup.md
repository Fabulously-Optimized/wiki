# Server setup

Fabulously Optimized is a strictly client-sided modpack, meaning it works and behaves the same on **every server that allows vanilla clients**. 

Yes, the CurseForge listing has a section of "server packs", but those are actually just the MultiMC versions that are marked as server packs for better visibility.

For server software I recommend using [Paper](https://papermc.io), which is a performance-optimized fork of Spigot, but supports all the same plugins. 

If you still like Fabric a lot, you can also [use that on a server too](https://fabricmc.net/use/?page=server) and check out [comp500's list](https://github.com/comp500/fabric-serverside-mods#performance) for some great server-side mods. There is a mod called Cardboard that lets you use Fabric with Spigot, [but is not recommended](https://gist.github.com/Patbox/e44844294c358b614d347d369b0fc3bf) - just pick one or the other.
