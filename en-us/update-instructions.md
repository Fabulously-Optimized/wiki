### Minecraft Launcher (vanilla)

Currently the only way to update is to "reinstall" the pack. Consider installing a different launcher for a smoother upgrade experience.

1. Download and install [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) **version 0.14.10**
   * Older versions of the modpack - 1.12.3 and 2.7.3 need Fabric Loader 0.13.3.
   * Remember that the _installer version_ doesn't matter, what matters is the _loader version_ that appears when you run the installer.
2. Open Minecraft Launcher, click `Installations` and then click üìÇ on the Fabric installation
3. Delete all files in `mods` folder
   * This is to ensure all mods will reflect the latest FO version. You can [add your custom mods back later](adding-more-mods.md).
4. Go to [Files](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/fabulously-optimized/files) on CurseForge
5. Click `Download` the latest **MultiMC version** of the pack
   * Don't see the MultiMC version? Click the title of the CurseForge version you need and scroll down, you'll find the MultiMC variant there.
      * Alternatively, look for it in the sidebar, under "server packs".
   * If you don't see any mods inside the zip or only see one, you downloaded the wrong version.
6. Open the zip file, go to _Fabulously Optimized x.x.x_ > _.minecraft_
7. Copy **all folders** from zip's .minecraft folder to your .minecraft folder; if asked - replace the files
8. If you want [FO default settings](changed-options.md) as well, delete `options.txt` (your vanilla options will be reset)
9. Launch the installed Fabric profile
10. If you now see "Fabulously Optimized" in the right bottom corner and its version number is newer than before, you're done!

### Resetting settings

Because the pack is using YOSBR, your vanilla options and most of the mod ones will not change when you upgrade, [despite what is stated in the changelog](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). This is made so that you can upgrade without having to reconfigure your options all the time. 

However, at some point you may still want to do that in order to get the latest changes. So:

1. Open the modpack folder
   * CurseForge Launcher: right click on the modpack tile ‚Üí `Open Folder`
   * MultiMC: right click on the instance ‚Üí `Minecraft Folder`
   * Prism Launcher: right click on the instance ‚Üí `Folder` ‚Üí `.minecraft`
   * GDLauncher: right click on the instance ‚Üí `Open Folder`
   * Vanilla launcher: go to `Installations` tab ‚Üí hover on the instance ‚Üí click `üìÅ`
2. Delete the `config` folder
   * If you prefer, also delete `options.txt` which stores vanilla options
3. Download [your version of FO again from Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized/versions)
4. Rename the file to `pack.zip`
5. Open the file you renamed, go to `overrides`
6. Copy/extract the folder `configs` out to the modpack folder you previously opened
   * You may delete the `pack.zip` after you're done
7. Launch the game. Modpack's defaults are now applied!
