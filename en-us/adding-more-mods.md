# Adding more mods

While I only intend to add mods that fit vanilla style, you are free to add any Fabric mod you want for your Minecraft! **However, please remove any custom mods before asking for support.**

This tutorial is with an assumption that you have the pack already installed and launcher opened. [If you don't, see these instructions.](install-instructions.md)

### CurseForge Launcher

Method 1:

1. Open CurseForge Launcher
2. Go to `My Modpacks`, click on Fabulously Optimized
3. Click on the three dots, select `Profile Options`
4. Check "Allow content management for this profile", click `Done`
5. Click `Add More Content`
6. Choose any mod you want and click Install. You can manage them later under Installed Mods tab
7. Run the game by clicking `Play`. You should now have the new mod(s) installed!

**Note: you must disable "Allow content management for this profile" in order to update the modpack.**

Method 2:

1. [Open CurseForge site](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods?filter-game-version=2020709689%3A7499\&filter-sort=4), search for a compatible mod
2. On the compatible version, click Install
3. CurseForge Launcher opens. Click `Select a profile`
4. Select "Fabulously Optimized", click `Install`
5. The mod will be added to the FO profile
6. Run the game by clicking `Play`. You should now have the new mod(s) installed!

### MultiMC/MultiMC (auto-update)

1. Open MultiMC
2. Click on Fabulously Optimized, then `Instance Folder`
3. Open [CurseForge mods page, set Game Version to Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods?filter-game-version=2020709689:7499)
4. Choose any mod you want and go to its _Files_ page
5. Make sure you download the latest version that is compatible with Fabric and your Minecraft version
6. Once downloaded, copy the JAR file to the pack's "mods" folder.
7. Run the game as usual. You should now have the new mod(s) installed!

### GDLauncher

1. Open GDLauncher
2. Right click Fabulously Optimized, click on `Manage`
3. Select `Mods` and `Add Mod`
4. Choose any mod you want (make sure it is for Fabric) and click `Download`
5. Close the sub-window and click on Fabulously Optimized to run the game. You should now have the new mod(s) installed!

### Minecraft Launcher (vanilla)

1. Open Minecraft Launcher, click on `Installations`
2. Click the folder icon on the profile you've created for the pack (could be named Fabric)
3. Open [CurseForge mods page, set Game Version to Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods?filter-game-version=2020709689:7499)
4. Choose any mod you want and go to its _Files_ page
