9. If you now see "Fabulously Optimized" in the right bottom corner, you're done!

A simple installer for vanilla launcher [is coming soon](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues/110)!

### Modrinth

There is indeed [an official listing of FO on Modrinth.](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized) However, it is currently experimental and there is no official launcher yet, so no instructions or support are given. 

Meanwhile you can `♡ Follow` the project to get notified of updates 🙂
 
### Other launchers

Technically you can install it in _some_ other launchers that support CurseForge modpacks or in _any_ launcher by following the vanilla instructions. However, I do not give support for them.

### Servers

Any server is supported, no installation or changes are necessary. See [server setup](server-setup.md) for more info.

### Quilt

There have been questions regarding whether Fabulously Optimized can be installed with [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org). The answer is: probably, while Fabric mods are still supported in it, but this modpack's maintainer does not provide support for that. [(You can ask in Quilt's Discord, though.)](https://discord.quiltmc.org/)

If there becomes a need, Fabulously Optimized will move to Quilt overall and then it will be fully supported. Read more on [issue #257](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues/257).
