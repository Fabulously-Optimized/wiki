### Other launchers

Technically you can install it in _some_ other launchers that support Curseforge modpacks or in _any_ launcher by following the vanilla instructions. However, I do not give support for them.

### Servers

Any server is supported, no installation or changes are necessary. See [server setup](server-setup.md) for more info.
