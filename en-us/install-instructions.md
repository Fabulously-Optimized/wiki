## Not supported

### Modrinth Launcher

Fabulously Optimized is [available on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), but an official launcher doesn't exist yet. When it gets released, it will be supported.
For now see [Prism Launcher](#prism-launcher) for a different launcher that also downloads from Modrinth.

### ATLauncher

ATLauncher is currently not supported simply because the interface is confusing and complex. There have been discussions with its developer to improve this and it may be considered in the future.

### PolyMC

**[PolyMC is considered unsafe](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues/496) and you should uninstall it immediately!**

To migrate to Prism Launcher (a safe fork of PolyMC), follow these instructions:

1. Uninstall PolyMC
2. Install [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/)
3. Go to one of these directories according to your operating system:
   - Portable (Windows / Linux): `PolyMC/instances`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%/PolyMC/instances`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/PolyMC/instances`
   - Linux: `~/.local/share/PolyMC/instances`
4. Select all the files and folders in the instances folder, right click on one of them and select `Copy`
5. Open Prism Launcher, click `Folders`, then `View Instance Folder`
6. Once your instance folder has opened, right click anywhere and select `Paste`
7. Close Prism Launcher and reopen it, your instances should be there
8. Sign in to your accounts, configure Prism Launcher to your preferences
9. If needed, [update](update-instructions.md#prism-launcher) or [install](install-instructions.md#prism-launcher) the modpack again
10. To run the modpack, double click the Fabulously Optimized icon

### Cracked launchers

Any launchers that let you run the game without having purchased it first are not supported.

There is a legitimate way to obtain Minecraft for cheaper: [get a giftcode from a trusted reseller!](https://punktid.com/minecraft-gift-code)

[Sign up with this referral link for additional 10% off](https://punktid.com/?ref=robotkoer).

After that, pick any supported launcher from this page and enjoy the game! 

### Other launchers

Technically you can install it in _some_ other launchers that support CurseForge or Modrinth modpacks or in _any_ launcher by following the vanilla instructions. However, please do not ask for support if you use an unsupported launcher.

## Servers

Any server is supported, no installation is necessary. Still, it is highly recommended to protect your users from chat reports on 1.19.1+, see [server setup](server-setup.md) for more info.

## Quilt

There have been questions regarding whether Fabulously Optimized can be installed with [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org). The answer is: probably, while Fabric mods are still supported in it, but this modpack's maintainer does not provide support for that. [(You can ask in Quilt's Discord, though.)](https://discord.quiltmc.org/)

If there becomes a need, Fabulously Optimized will move to Quilt overall and then it will be fully supported. Read more on [issue #257](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues/257).
