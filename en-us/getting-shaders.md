# Getting shaders

### OptiFine shaders

OptiFine shaders are supported using [Iris](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irisshaders)!

[Here is a list of recommended shaders.](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris/blob/trunk/docs/supportedshaders.md)

The installation is simple:

1. Open Minecraft with Fabulously Optimized installed
2. Open `Options...` → `Video Settings...` → `Shader Packs...`
3. Download any OptiFine-compatible shader pack, [recommended ones are here](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris/blob/trunk/docs/supportedshaders.md)
4. Drag the ZIP file into the shader pack screen
5. Select the shader, make sure _Shaders_ is set to enabled and click `Apply`
6. The shader has been applied! If you run into any problems with shaders, [please report them here](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris/issues).

If you want to configure individual settings:

1. Click a shader
2. Click `Shader Pack Settings...` below
3. Adjust settings as needed
4. Click `Shader Pack List...`
5. Click `Done`

### Fabulous shaders

If you want simpler shaders, you can also try the the ones that are supported natively in 1.16+ via enabling _Fabulous!_ graphics in settings.

1. [Fabulousity shader resource pack](https://github.com/ScottoMotto/Fabulousity#fabulousity)

* Sildur's [Fabulous Shaders resource pack](https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/downloads/) [(configuring instructions)](https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/install/#fabulous)
* [Depth Shaders resource pack](https://github.com/onnowhere/depth\_shaders/releases)

### Canvas shaders

[Canvas Renderer](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/canvas-renderer) is a mod that provides a new type of shaders that may be better optimized for powerful computers. If you install it, **make sure to remove Sodium, Sodium Extra, Reese's Sodium Settings and Iris** as Canvas is incompatible with those.

* [Lumi Lights resource pack](https://spiralhalo.github.io)

### Core shaders

Core shaders are also a kind of vanilla shaders, usually utilized by resource packs to adjust the vanilla HUD. These may cause severe texture glitches and are therefore not supported on Fabulously Optimized.
You may, however, still get them to work properly by removing Sodium and related mods (see [Canvas](#canvas-shaders) above)
