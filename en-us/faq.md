# Vanilla launcher FAQ

## What is this?

- This FAQ gives answers to questions you might have about the vanilla launcher. Please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/yxaXtaQqdB) and visit the 'support' channel if you have any additional questions. 

### How to install?

- There are many ways to install FO on multiple launchers. Please use this [guide](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/install-instructions#minecraft-launcher-vanilla) to install FO on the launcher that you use.

### So I just copy the mods, right?

- No. Fabulously Optimized consists of mods, configs and a resource pack that is built to help the user naviagte through Mod Menu. If you simply copy the mods over, the settings would not be applied, and since you would have to configure the mods yourself, you might not have the proper settings to accurately replicate OptiFine.

### What is the MultiMC ZIP?

- The MultiMC ZIP is a packaged instance for the launcher called MultiMC. It is distributed in CurseForge because MultiMC itself no longer supports downloading CurseForge modpacks and downloads from the ZIP file support the creator of FO. This also allows for a better installation of FO for vanilla launcher users.

### What is in the ZIP file?

- In both the CurseForge and MultiMC ZIP files, they contain configs for each mod and resource packs which are essential for FO to run. Without these files, the modpack would not be configured properly which could lead to not having the right settings to replicate OptiFine.

### Why try a different launcher?

- There are a variety of launchers available, each with unique features. If you use the vanilla launcher, you miss out on many features, including the ability to update the modpack and the version of Minecraft, add any mod with a few simple clicks, and finally download the modpack more easily.

### Why is FO not a client?

- FO is not a client because simply we would need to be able to code a client which would require people to know the programming language that we are writing the client in. By being a modpack, this makes it easier for the creator and user to add their own mods in and use Fabulously Optimized as base pack for their own mods they want to add in. This can also make it easier to update the modpack by adding in replacement mods while waiting for other mods in the pack to update.
### Is there an easier way to install FO?

- For the time being, we advise using launchers like CurseForge Launcher, MultiMC, and GDLauncher to make it simple and easy to install and update the modpack and have extra features which can help with downloading mods or downloading a new Minecraft version. On the other hand, if you wish to install FO on the vanilla launcher, you can use this [guide](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/install-instructions#minecraft-launcher-vanilla) if you want to install FO on the vanilla launcher. A vanilla Installer that will make it simpler to install the modpack on the vanilla launcher will be soon made available, you can check out the [Github Repo](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/vanilla-installer) for the installer to see when a beta could be released.
