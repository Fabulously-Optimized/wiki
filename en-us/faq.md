# Vanilla launcher FAQ


This FAQ gives answers to questions you might have about using Fabulously Optimized with the vanilla launcher. Please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/yxaXtaQqdB) and visit the 'support' channel if you have any additional questions. 

### How to install?

To install FO on the Vanilla Launcher, [please follow this guide](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/install-instructions#minecraft-launcher-vanilla).

### So I just copy the mods, right?

No. Fabulously Optimized consists of mods, configs and resourcepacks. If you skip configurations, there is a high chance of some resource packs not working at all, mods may have unwanted features enabled or wanted features disabled. If you skip resource packs, you'll lose out on the descriptions that explain what each mod does in Mod Menu.

### What is the MultiMC ZIP?

The MultiMC ZIP is a packaged instance for the launcher called MultiMC. It is distributed in CurseForge because MultiMC itself no longer supports downloading CurseForge modpacks and downloads from CurseForge support the creator of FO. This also allows for an easy installation of FO for vanilla launcher users.

### What is in the ZIP file?

In both the CurseForge and MultiMC ZIP files, they include resource packs that are necessary for FO to function, as well as configuration files for each mod. 

- The resourcepacks folder - Contains a resource pack that gives descriptions that explain what each mod does in Mod Menu and aids in navigating through the mod menu.

- The config folder - Contains configs for each mod in FO so that the modpack is perfectly configured when you first start it up. It also contains a folder called 'yosbr' which allows to give default configs without changing them each tine you update the modpack

### Why try a different launcher?

There are a variety of launchers available, each with unique features. The vanilla launcher is a basic launcher, and it is missing many features that other launchers have. You miss out on many features, including the ability to download the modpack more easily, update the modpack and the version of Minecraft, and add any mod with a few simple clicks. Also, you would miss out on some unique features that only some launchers have like a built-in modpack browser and a built-in mod browser which allows you to download mods and modpacks without having to go to CurseForge or Modrinth and a more user-friendly / modern interface.

### Why is FO not a client?

FO is also not a client because simply we would need explicit permission from the mod authors to use their mods in a client and the authors of each mod would receive no benefits by being included in a client. We would also need to be able to code a client which would require lots of time and maintenance to keep the client up to date with the latest version of Minecraft. By being a modpack, this makes it easier for the creator and user to add their own mods in and use Fabulously Optimized as base pack for their own mods they want to add in. This can also make it easier to update the modpack by adding in replacement mods while waiting for other mods in the pack to update.

### Is there an easier way to install FO?

Soon, there will be an installer that will make it easier to install the modpack on the vanilla launcher. You can check out the [relevant issue](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues/110) to see when a beta could be released. However, we still advise you to prefer other launchers like CurseForge Launcher, as they make installing, updating and adding mods much easier than vanilla ever can, and support the development of the modpack alongside it.
