# Server-Einrichtung

Fabulously Optimized is a strictly client-sided modpack, meaning it works and behaves the same on every server that allows vanilla clients. Yes, the Curseforge listing has a section of "server packs", but those are actually just the MultiMC versions that are marked as server packs for better visibility.&#x20;

For server software I recommend using [Paper](https://papermc.io), which is a performance-optimized fork of Spigot, but supports all the same plugins.

If you still like Fabric a lot, you can also [use that on a server too](https://fabricmc.net/use/?page=server) and check out [comp500's list](https://github.com/comp500/fabric-serverside-mods#performance) for some great server-side mods. And if you're feeling really adventurous, [you can even run Fabric with Spigot](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cardboard).
