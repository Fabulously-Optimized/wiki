# About

Fabulously Optimized ("FO") is simple pack for Minecraft: Java Edition, focusing on performance and graphics enhancements.

What separates FO from other similar modpacks?

## Accessibility

We take accessibility very seriously. We believe everyone should be able to use FO, no matter which [launcher they use](../how-to/install/), which [language they speak](contribute/translate.md) or which [server they like to play on](servers.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
Read more about [accessibility](accessibility.md).
{% endhint %}

## Community

FO is built with the community and for the community: we want to fix the [issues **you** have](https://download.fo/issues), include the [mods **you** like](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues/new?template=mod-request.yml). We [host public votes for choosing mods](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues/21#issuecomment-998162829), we [revert changes the community dislikes](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#131-2020-09-29), and we collaborate with mod authors by reporting issues and suggesting fixes.

## Consistency

FO has to be sustainable, future-ready, 100% server-compatible, and it should work similarly across versions. New mods and changes are carefully evaluated, to make sure they fit well with the rest of FO, they "feel" vanilla, and their authors are ready to support them in the future.

## Familiarity

One of FO's objectives is to achieve parity, where possible, with other Minecraft platforms, including Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, OptiFine, snapshots and the like. Note that parity does not necessarily mean identical behavior.

{% endhint %}

## Neutrality

FO should only give you the essential tools and fixes to your game, so it does not include any new content, nor any opinionated extras (like mini-maps, armor HUD, more sounds...). FO tries to maintain neutrality, without taking sides.

{% hint style="info" %}
Read more about [what happened with Player Reporting](../info/mods/player-reporting.md), a delicate question where FO proved to be as neutral as it could.
{% endhint %}

## Privacy

Your data is yours, and you must be able to choose who gets to access it. FO tries, where possible, to avoid giving your information to third-parties, including servers, mods, and Mojang. We believe you should not be punished for using innocent mods, or for using the "wrong" optimization mod.

## Transparency

FO is [open-source](https://download.fo/github), and so is most of its mods. Its [content](../info/) is clearly listed, its [changes over time](https://download.fo/changelog) are clearly outlined, and it's ready to inform its users about new game features or drastic changes (such as [Player Reporting](../info/mods/player-reporting.md)) and to alarm its users about vulnerabilities affecting the game.

## Updates

FO receives fast updates because it's [based on Fabric](fabric.md). It's consistently one of the first packs to upgrade to newer Minecraft versions.
