# Terms

By using Fabulously Optimized ("FO"), YOU agree to the following terms:

* **NOT AN OFFICIAL MINECRAFT PRODUCT. NOT APPROVED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH MOJANG OR MICROSOFT**
* By installing FO, YOU agree that its authors, its mods' developers, Mojang and any other third party do not provide any warranties for using it. YOU are responsible for every action YOU do with it
* FO is set up to be compatible with the rules of most public third-party servers, but it is YOUR responsibility to verify whether YOU are allowed to use FO or not
* FO uses mods to support controllers with analog input, which may produce unexpectedly smooth movements; such smooth movements may be disallowed on some third-party servers. YOU are notified of this upon newly joining any server with a controller and with analog input enabled. YOU are expected to add servers which disallow this feature to the mods' allowlist, or to disable the analog input entirely
* FO disables the tutorial hint for ["Social Interactions"](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Social_interactions#Usage) hotkey disclaimer shown when joining a server for the first time. YOU can access the "Social Interactions" screen with the <kbd>**Player Reporting**</kbd> button in the pause menu or by pressing <kbd>P</kbd>
*   FO disables the third-party server disclaimer shown when using the multiplayer function for the first time. By using FO, YOU implicitly agree to the following disclaimer:

    > Caution: Online play is offered by third-party servers that are not owned, operated, or supervised by Mojang Studios or Microsoft. During online play, you may be exposed to unmoderated chat messages or other types of user-generated content that may not be suitable for everyone
* FO uses "No Chat Reports" to opt out of chat signing on servers where chat signing is optional. FO adds an icon to the chat bar to indicate the status of Mojang's chat safety features on such a server. Read more about [Player Reporting](../info/mods/player-reporting.md)
* FO uses "e4mc" to allow local LAN worlds to be hosted through the Internet and accessed by YOUR friends, without additional software or mods on YOUR friends' devices. This feature only activates when opening a world to LAN, and it connects to an external proxy server, which generates a randomized subdomain for YOUR friends. FO does not share YOUR IP address with YOUR friends. This feature is automatically disabled once YOU disconnect from the world, or once YOU click on the link shown automatically in chat as soon as the world is opened to LAN
* FO disables Mojang's "Telemetry Data Collection", it disables its mods' update checkers, and it disables cosmetic features exclusive to donors. FO may disable other privacy-invading network services. Read more about [Telemetry](../info/telemetry.md)
* FO does not host any paid-for capes or cosmetics, nor does it encourage YOU to buy them from any provider. Instead of such encouragement, FO provides instructions for YOU to get a free cape, and it also gives YOU options to use some cosmetics YOU had previously obtained from other providers. Read more about [capes](../info/mods/capes.md)
* If YOU're forking FO, YOU also agree to the [additional terms regarding forks](contribute/fork.md).
