### Performance

Fabulously Optimized is faster than OptiFine, thanks to [modern performance mods][1] like Sodium, Lithium, and others. The bundled mods have been carefully selected to be safe in your worlds and provide noticeable speed benefits on any device.

### OptiFine parity

Fabulously Optimized [supports most OptiFine features][2], including shaders, connected textures, and zoom. If your resource pack states "OptiFine required," it will probably function here as well. [You can even get your own free cape!][3]

### Feels familiar

Fabulously Optimized includes features that allow you to experience Minecraft just as you remember it, no matter what version you've used before. This means you can [use game controllers, play local worlds with friends, view advancements in a large window, and much more][4].

### Works everywhere

Fabulously Optimized does not include content mods, so you can play on any world or server. While you can use any game launcher to play the pack, [we recommend and provide support for specific ones that offer the best experience][5].

### Up to date

Fabulously Optimized [receives fast updates][6] and stands as one of the first modpacks to upgrade to newer Minecraft versions. [Updating the modpack is easy][7] and will preserve your mod settings, where possible.

### Built on Fabric

Fabulously Optimized uses the Fabric mod loader, which is lightweight, fast, and supports a lot of mods. [You can use the modpack as a base to add your favorite mods to.][8]

### Open development

Fabulously Optimized [is open-source][9], and so are most of its mods. We welcome user suggestions and collaborate with mod developers to create a better user experience for everyone.
