### "Update your mod"

Unfortunately [MinecraftCapes updated their servers](https://github.com/CaelTheColher/Capes/issues/118), which causes this message to appear on users' capes in older versions of FO. Here are your options, pick _one_:

- [Update Fabulously Optimized to latest version](update-instructions.md) - the easiest and best solution.
-  [Remove Capes](disabling-mods.md) and [install](adding-more-mods.md) [MinecraftCapes](https://modrinth.com/mod/minecraftcapes) instead - fixes the message, but you'll lose out on other providers like OptiFine capes.
- Disable MinecraftCapes support - gets rid of the message, but also this provider's capes in general (you can no longer use the free cape instructions above).
   * Go to `Options...` → `Skin Customization...` → ![Capes icon](https://github.com/CaelTheColher/Capes/blob/architectury/common/src/main/resources/assets/capes/textures/gui/sprites/icon/cape_options.png?raw=true) → `Toggle` → `MinecraftCapes: OFF` → `Done` → `Done` → `Done`.
- [Remove Capes](disabling-mods.md) and [install](adding-more-mods.md) [Cosmetica](https://modrinth.com/mod/cosmetica) - fixes the message and keeps other providers, but the experience can highly vary from FO defaults, so it is recommended to configure the mod to suit your needs.
   * Go to `Mods` → search "Cosmetica" → press ![config](https://i.ibb.co/j35cBtn/image.png) → configure by your preferences.

### Disclaimer

Fabulously Optimized does not host any capes or other cosmetics, nor does it encourage users to buy them from any provider. Instead, the modpack encourages users to prefer free cosmetics, while also giving them options to use any paid cosmetics they've previously obtained from certain providers.
