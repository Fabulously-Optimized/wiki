# Principles

Since Fabulously Optimized was created, several similar packs have started appearing. So what separates this from the rest?

* **Accessibility**  - Fabulously Optimized supports [several launchers](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized#downloads), is [hosted on three sites](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized#downloads), [supports various languages](language-support.md). Read more about [accessibility in this modpack](accessibility.md).
* **Community** - Fabulously Optimized is developed with the community, [helping you fix problems](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues),  [considering your mod suggestions](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues), [hosting public votes for mod inclusion](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues/21#issuecomment-998162829) and [even reverting changes if they were not popular](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#131-2020-09-29). The author also contributes to the mods themselves by reporting issues and suggesting fixes.
* **Consistency** - Fabulously Optimized must be sustainable, 100% server-compatible and it should work similarly across versions. Every new mod and change is carefully considered to make sure it would work well, feel vanilla and be available in the future.
* **Familiarity** - main priority is having parity with OptiFine, but sometimes Forge, Bedrock Edition and snapshots are considered as well. Note that the parity does _not_ mean identical behavior, existing FO users and vanilla-like Java Edition users' preferences are highly considered in general.
* **Neutrality** - the modpack should only give you the essential tools and fixes to customize your game, not include any opinionated extras itself (e.g. a mod that adds a minimap, armor HUD or more sounds). 
* **Privacy** - you shall not be punished for "having too many mods" or "using the wrong zoom mod". In simpler terms, the client tells as little about itself to the servers, mods and Mojang as possible, even though the mods are already allowed by most servers' rules.
* **Transparency** - Fabulously Optimized is [open source](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/LICENSE.md) (including the majority of its mods), documented in this wiki, [changes are outlined](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md), [mods are clearly listed](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized#included-mods) with their creator and purpose. Sometimes users need to be educated [about important new game features as well](chat-reporting-faq.md#what-does-this-modpack-do-for-me).
* **Updates** - Fabulously Optimized [receives fast updates](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) and is one of the first modpacks to upgrade to newer Minecraft versions.

### Why use Fabric?

Some facts about Fabric that can make you reconsider using (Neo)Forge...

* **Fabric updates fast** - on the same day as Minecraft itself, and so do many of its mods
* **Fabric loads fast** - roughly the same as vanilla Minecraft, unlike Forge that takes minutes to open
* **Fabric is small** - no huge libraries taking space on your computer, for most mods you only need the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)
* **Fabric is popular** - there are [more than 8000 mods on CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/search?page=1&class=mc-mods&gameFlavorsIds=4&sortType=1&pageSize=20) and [more than 4000 mods on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mods?f=categories%3Afabric&g=categories%3A%27fabric%27) (most overlap though)
* **Fabric is supported** - many mod developers support both Fabric and NeoForge nowadays, many even moved on to only Fabric now
* **Fabric is compatible** - many mod developers work together to keep their mods compatible with each other
* **Fabric is easy** - many launchers are supported, and the [installers are accessible right from the homepage](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)
