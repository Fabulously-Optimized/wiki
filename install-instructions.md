### [Minecraft Launcher](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download) (vanilla)

For macOS or Linux [you need Java](https://adoptium.net/) to run the Fabric Installer.

1. Download and install [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) **version 0.14.22**
   * Older versions of the modpack - 1.12.3, 2.7.3 and 3.14.1 require the use of Fabric Loader 0.14.12 instead.
   * Remember that the _installer version_ doesn't matter, what matters is the _loader version_ that appears when you run the installer.
2. Download some mods manually as needed:
   * **FO 5.2.9**: Download [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium/version/mc1.20-0.4.10) and [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris/version/1.6.4+1.20)
   * **FO 4.11.0**: Download [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium/version/mc1.19.4-0.4.10)
3. Open Minecraft Launcher, click `Installations`, then click üìÇ on the Fabric installation
4. Go to [Files](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/fabulously-optimized/files?showAlphaFiles=show) on CurseForge
5. Click the topmost version, scroll down to "Additional files" section
6. Click `‚ãÆ` ‚Üí `Download file` on the latest **MultiMC version**
   * If you see less than 10 mods in the zip, you downloaded the wrong version.  
7. Open the zip file, go to _Fabulously Optimized x.x.x_ > _minecraft_
8. Copy **all folders** from zip's _minecraft_ folder to your _.minecraft_ folder; if asked - replace the files
9. **FO 4.11.0+**: Copy downloaded mod JAR(s) to _mods_ folder
10. It is highly recommended to delete `options.txt` as well to get [FO default settings](changed-options.md)
    * Your vanilla options like selected resource packs, language, keybinds will be reset but you can reapply them later.
    * If you choose not to do this, it is recommended to at least enable bundled resource packs manually.
11. Launch the installed Fabric profile
12. If you now see "Fabulously Optimized" in the right bottom corner, you're done!

A simple installer for vanilla launcher [is coming soon](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues/110)!

### [Pojav Launcher](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher) (Android)

Fabulously Optimized can indeed be run on a mobile device! Be aware:

* This process has a lot of steps which you must follow carefully.
* The tutorial is made for Android devices - phones and tablets. iOS devices _could_ work, but that requires jailbreak or sideloading an alternative store, the steps are probably more complicated.
* Your device must be "mid-range" or "high-end" if you want decent FPS. 6+ GB RAM recommended.
* Pojav Launcher supports Android 5 and up, but these instructions were tested on Android 13.
* Your device will likely heat and consume a lot of battery as you play. It is _not_ as device-optimized as Bedrock Edition.
* Attempts have been made to improve performance, but depending on your device you may need to adjust video settings.
* In the worst case, you may not get it running at all. Try again after Pojav Launcher updates.

## Not supported

### GDLauncher

Due to technical limits and issues, GDLauncher is no longer supported. It is recommended to migrate to Prism Launcher:

1. [Install and run Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/)
2. Click `Add Instance`
3. Select `Modrinth` tab from the left
4. Select "Fabulously Optimized"
5. Click `OK`
6. The modpack will now install.
7. Once installed, click the `Folder` button on the left.
8. Open GDLauncher
9. Right click on your previously used instance ‚Üí `Open Folder`
10. Copy the important files and folders over:
    * `saves` for your local worlds
    * `resourcepacks`, if you use any (do not copy old versions of FO-bundled packs though)
    * `screenshots`
    * `servers.dat` for your multiplayer servers
    * `options.txt`, if you want to keep your vanilla option changes
11. Launch the instance on Prism and confirm everything is correct
12. Uninstall GDLauncher

[GDLauncher Carbon](https://gdlauncher.com/en/blog/curseforge-partnership-announcement/) may be supported in the future.

### Modrinth app

Fabulously Optimized is [available on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), but Modrinth's own official launcher is currently in open beta with some bugs. When it gets released and the required bugs fixed, it will be supported.
For now see [Prism Launcher](#prism-launcher) for a different launcher that also downloads from Modrinth.

### ATLauncher

_Not to be confused with [TLauncher](#tlauncher)._

ATLauncher is currently not supported simply because the interface is confusing and complex. There have been discussions with its developer to improve this and it may be considered in the future.

### PolyMC

**[PolyMC is compromised](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues/496) and you should uninstall it immediately!**

To migrate to Prism Launcher (a safe fork of PolyMC), follow these instructions:

1. Uninstall PolyMC
2. Install [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/)
3. Launch it and pay attention to the prompt you get:
    1. > It looks like you used PolyMC before. Do you want to migrate your data to the new location of Prism Launcher?
         * Click `Yes` and the migration will complete.
    2. > It looks like you used PolyMC on Windows before. Do you want to migrate your data to the new location of Prism Launcher?
         * Click `Yes` and the migration will complete.
    3. > Old data from PolyMC was found, but you already have existing data for Prism Launcher. Sadly you will need to migrate yourself. Do you want to be reminded of the pending data migration next time you start Prism Launcher?
        * Click `No` and follow manual migration instructions below.
4. If needed, [update](update-instructions.md#prism-launcher) or [install](install-instructions.md#prism-launcher) the modpack again
5. To run the modpack, double click the Fabulously Optimized icon

<details>
  <summary>Manual migration</summary>

  1. Close Prism Launcher
  2. Go to one of these directories according to your operating system:
      - Portable (Windows/Linux): `PolyMC/instances`
      - Windows: `%APPDATA%/PolyMC/instances`
      - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/PolyMC/instances`
      - Linux: `~/.local/share/PolyMC/instances`
  2. Select all the files and folders in the instances folder, right click on one of them and select `Copy`
  3. Open Prism Launcher, click `Folders`, then `View Instance Folder`
  4. Once your instance folder has opened, right click anywhere and select `Paste`
  5. Close Prism Launcher and reopen it, your instances should be there
  6. Sign in to your accounts, configure Prism Launcher to your preferences

</details>

### TLauncher

_Not to be confused with [ATLauncher](#atlauncher)._

[TLauncher is malware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBTH9n6lz9o), so it will never be supported by Fabulously Optimized.
It is highly recommended to [reset your entire computer](https://www.howtogeek.com/202590/stop-trying-to-clean-your-infected-computer-just-nuke-it-and-reinstall-windows/), then come back to this page and follow install instructions for any supported launcher.

### Cracked launchers

Any launchers that let you run the game without having purchased it first are not supported.

There is a legitimate way to obtain Minecraft for cheaper: [get a giftcode from a trusted reseller!](https://punktid.com/minecraft-java-bedrock) Sign up with [this referral link for additional 10% off](https://punktid.com/?ref=robotkoer).
After that, pick any supported launcher from this page and enjoy the game! 

### Other launchers

Technically you can install it in _some_ other launchers that support CurseForge or Modrinth modpacks or in _any_ launcher by following the vanilla instructions. However, please do not ask for support if you use an unsupported launcher.

### Other modpacks

Some users have experienced interest in using FO with other, content-focused modpacks. 

While it is theoretically possible, this is **not advised**:

* mods may have conflicts
* neither FO or the other modpack will be able to support you

Instead, we recommend you to use FO with [other mods added by you](adding-more-mods.md).

### Game clients

Fabulously Optimized is not compatible with any "game clients", including "hacked clients" and "PvP clients". [Use normal mods instead!](adding-more-mods.md)

### Bedrock Edition

Fabulously Optimized is not compatible with Bedrock Edition. See [Pojav Launcher](#pojav-launcher-android) for an alternative.

## Servers

Any server is supported, no installation is necessary. See [server setup](server-setup.md) for tips.

## Quilt

Fabulously Optimized is currently based on Fabric, not Quilt. It _may_ run on [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org), but it has not been tested and is not currently supported to ensure all mods work reliably. If you use it, do not ask for support in FO's Discord, but rather [Quilt's Discord](https://discord.quiltmc.org/).

If there becomes a need, Fabulously Optimized will move to Quilt overall and then it will be fully supported. Read more on [issue #257](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues/257).
